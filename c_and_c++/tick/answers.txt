Exercise 1

server.c loads the file specified in the arguments during initialization and then runs in an infinite loop,
accepting any incoming client connections. Whenever a client connects, the contents of that file is sent in
chunks of size BUFSIZE.
client.c tries to connect to the specified address and port, and sends to standard output whatever it reads
from the socket.

Errors:
    Line 19 in server.c: condition should be (argc != 3), not (argc != 2)
    Line 74 in server.c: missing }
    Line 57 in server.c: w isn't initialised to 0
    Line 39 in client.c: array size should be BUFSIZE, not BUFSIZE-1
